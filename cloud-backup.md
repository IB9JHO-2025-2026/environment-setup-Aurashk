# How to use a Codespace to work on IB9JHO
Please note that:
- You should always select the **clang compiler** when prompted while you are working on IB9JHO. This ensures we are all using the same build tools.
- Your work on a codespace will be saved even when you close it down, but they do expire after a period of time. You should
   push your changes to the repository regularly (see [this section](#pushing-your-changes-to-github)) to avoid losing your work. 
- You should NOT create multiple codespaces to work on the same repository. You should create a single codespace and close/re-open it when needed.

You can use github to create new codespaces and open existing ones in your web browser.

*Create and run a codespace through github.*

Or you can open them in vscode (which is installed on your device) if you add the codespaces extension.
